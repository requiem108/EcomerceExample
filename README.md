# MERM WEB STORE TYPE AMAZON

# About this app


It's a practice I got on youtube about a web store, in which I use MERM stack.
For this practice I only use the code in git to compare in case of syntax error, the main objective is to practice with react and use elements such as element and context propagation, server express, mongo bases and much more.
